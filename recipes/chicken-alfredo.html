          <h3>Description</h3>

          <p>This is my wifes favorite recipe. Once you get it down, this recipe is very easy to make.
             Most of the time I don't measure ingredients. If you are a fan of very creamy alfredo then
             this is the alfredo for you. I like to top it with chicken. However you can do crab, chicken, shrimp etc.
          </p>

          <h4>Ingredients</h4>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Chicken Thighs</strong> - 1-2Lbs I like chicken thighs better than breast.
                Chicken thighs are less likely to get dry. </li>
                <li><strong>Heavy Whipping Cream</strong> - 2 cups Use any brand. I buy the cheap kind from meijer. Doesn't need to be name brand.</li>
                <li><strong>Mozzerella Cheese</strong> - 16 oz Whole milk mozzerella cheese is the goto. It has a richer flavor and thickens the sauce well</li>
                <li><strong>Parmesean Cheese</strong> - 1 cup Freshly grated parmesean is the best. However I use the kind off of the shelf its still delicious</li>
                <li><strong>Fettuchini Noodles</strong> - 1/2 Box. Grab whatever brand you like. We use barilla brand non gluten fettuchini noodles.</li>
                <li><strong>Butter</strong> - 2 Tbps I use grass fed butter from costco. You can use whatever you like.</li>
                <li><strong>Avocado Oil</strong> - 2 Tbps A lot of people use olive oil. I use avocado oil because its healthy and doesn't smoke.</li>
                <li><strong>Garlic</strong> - 2-3 Tbps I like a lot of garlic so I add extra. Use minced garlic.</li>
                <li><strong>White Pepper</strong> - 1/2 Tsp Adds a little flavor and doesnt change the color of the alfredo</li>
                <li><strong>Lemon </strong> - 1/2 a lemon to maranade the chicken with.</li>
                <li><strong>Paprika</strong> - 1 Tbps This is part of the chicken marinade adds color and flavor</li>
                <li><strong>Salt</strong> - To taste. Add as little or as much salt as you would like. I normally don't add it to the alfredo but I add it to the chicken.</li>
                <li><strong>Black Pepper</strong> - To taste. Added to the marinade.</li>
                <li><strong>Onion Powder</strong> 1 Tbsp. This adds really good flavor to the chicken.</li>
            
            </ul>
