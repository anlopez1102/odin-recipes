            <h3>Description</h3>

            <p>This mouthwatering lasagna recipe will have your family <strong>BEGGING</strong> for more.
                All you need is a few ingredients, a 8x12" pan, and a spatula.
                Homemade lasagna is one of my favorite meals. This wont dissapoint.
            </p>
            <p><em>Tip use oven bake noodles so you don't have to boil them</em></p>

            <h4>Ingredients</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Lasagna Noodles</strong>- You can use regular lasagna noodles
                    but I would use oven bake noodles</li>
                    <li><strong>Ground Beef</strong>- 80/20 ground beef is best. You don't want your ground beef
                    to be too lean. Fat equals flavor. If you would like to go vegetarian mushrooms is a great substitute.</li>
                    <li><strong>Garlic</strong>- Freshly minced garlic will add more flavor. If all you have is
                    garlic powder feel free to use that in its place. We prefer minced garlic for this recipe.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sphagetti Sauce</strong>- Use your favorite jar of spaghetti sauce. Our preferred sauce is 
                    Rao's marinara. Its not exaclty sphagetti sauce but it is delicios.</li>
                    <li><strong>Parmesean</strong>- For the freshest taste you should shred your own lasagna. However you can Use
                    the powdered kind</li>
                    <li><strong>Mozzerella</strong>- In my recipe I use whole milk mozzerella. It melts perfectly and has a rich flavor.
                    Mozzerella is a must. If you have to substitue provolone is ok</li>
                    <li><strong>Cottage Cheese</strong>- 4% and whole milk cottage cheese has a better flavor and texture. Our preferred
                    brand is horizon organic</li>
                </ul>
